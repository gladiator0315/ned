# [github.com/nealmick/ImGui_Ned_Embed](https://github.com/nealmick/ImGui_Ned_Embed)

Ned can be embedded in other ImGui applications, taking advantage of its text editor, file explorer, and terminal emulator. The embedded version also includes emoji support, themes, and much more. We have a demo repository that shows how to get started embedding the neditor into your projects.







# About the Project
Ned is a feature-rich text editor built with Dear ImGui that combines the power of modern development tools with a lightweight, embeddable architecture. At its core, Ned provides a sophisticated text editing experience with Tree Sitter syntax highlighting supporting over 15 programming languages including C++, Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, and more. The editor features custom lexer modes for specialized file types and includes advanced features like multi-cursor editing, line jumping, and a built-in file tree explorer.

The editor includes LSP integration with support for clangd, gopls, pyright, and TypeScript language servers, providing goto definition, find references, and symbol information. Ned also includes a terminal emulator and AI integration with OpenRouter support. The editor features emoji support with proper font rendering, custom shader effects, and a theming system. The project is designed to be embeddable in other ImGui applications through the ned_embed library, making it easy to integrate into your own projects.

Currently Ned is tested on MacOs both Arm and Intel, There is also a debian build availabe.  Windows is not support, but hopefully will added in future.  

If you have questions or issues feel free to reach out.
